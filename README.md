## Link to Deployed Application

## Description
- I wrote the css, html, and javascript code to create the functions of a coding quiz, as well as styling and layout.
- The purpose of this application is to enable users to complete the coding assessment which consists of multiple choice questions about javacript.
- By the end of the quiz, user is able to view his/her score and placing compared to previous highscores.
- During this process, I gained an understanding of buillding css, html, and javascript code from scratch and combining the three different files with efficient distribution to create a webpage.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
- This application allows users to test their knowledge of javascript fundamentals by taking a timed quiz so that the user can gauge his/hetr progress compared to peers.
- The "Start Quiz" button triggers the first multiple choice question and starts the timer of 60 seconds.
- When the user gets it right, it triggers a text saying "CORRECT" and moves on to the next question.
- When the user gets it wrong, it triggers a text saying "WRONG", deducts 10 seconds from the timer, and moves on to the next question.
- When user completes all questions or timer runs out, it triggers a form where users can enter their initials to store their scores.
- When user clickes on "View High Scores", user can view scores from all other users including his/hers.
